# The Striking Arts

The Striking Arts is an app aiming to make your martial arts journey more enjoyable. It’s everything from a simple countdown timer, to your pad-work partner shouting combos at you, minus the spittles.

## Features

* Fully functional calendar that tracks your workout sessions
* The possibility of aborting a workout (and optionally be blamed for doing so)
* The ability to divide each round into segments. It usually comes to play when you’re switching between training different aspects of your game, each for a fixed duration of a round
* Visual defense training
* Aural offense training 🤔
* A comprehensive set of techniques with pre-recorded audio
* 43 complete combos, ranging from simple to um, unpleasant
* 5 complete pre-made workouts
